How to install the project and run it?
As of right now the easiest way to run the game is to import the zip file as a project into Eclipse (or other Java compiler) and run the starter class.
If you want to contribute you can also just download the zip and import into eclipse.

Why did I make this?
This project is similar to a final project I did in University, though it is not as complex I feel it demonstrates good understanding of some object oriented design: particulary 
polymorphism, inheritance, modularity and reusability. This project helped me understand the importance and convenience of some of these principles that a textbook couldn't
explain to me fully. It's also a project that I'm proud to show friends and family, most of the projects are did in university had to do with databases and implementing algorithms
which aren't very fun to show to people.
